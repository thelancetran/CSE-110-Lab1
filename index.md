## Who I am as a person

### Academia
I am currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year student majoring in Math-CS at UCSD. 
For me, I feel like my major directly reflects my academic passion, as I enjoy the theory behind mathematics combined with the intricacies and creativeness of computer science. 
Some of my favorite classes that I have taken include:  
* Math 184 (*Enumerative Combinatorics*)
* CSE 100 (*Advanced Data Structures*)
* Math 103A (*Modern Algebra I*)
> "If you are given a 'prove or disprove' problem, it most likely is disprove..."
* CSE 101 (*Design & Analysis of Algorithm*)
  
### Personal
In my free time, I enjoy exercising, gaming, and cooking. 
If I had to rank my top 3 favorite exercises, I would have the following:  
1. Barbell Bench Press
2. Pull-Ups
3. Machine Pec Fly
  
Additionally, my top game currently is [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/).
Something that I cooked recently that I am proud of is this [beef stew served with rice]().
