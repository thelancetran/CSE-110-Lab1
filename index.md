## Who I am as a person

### Academia
I am currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year student majoring in Math-CS at UCSD. 
For me, I feel like my major directly reflects my academic passion, as I enjoy the theory behind mathematics combined with the intricacies and creativeness of computer science. 
Some of my favorite classes that I have taken include:  
* Math 184 (*Enumerative Combinatorics*)
* CSE 100 (*Advanced Data Structures*)
* Math 103A (*Modern Algebra I*)
> "If you are given a 'prove or disprove' problem, it most likely is disprove..."
* CSE 101 (*Design & Analysis of Algorithm*)
  
### Personal
In my free time, I enjoy exercising, gaming, and cooking. 
If I had to rank my top 3 favorite exercises, I would have the following:  
1. Barbell Bench Press
2. Pull-Ups
3. Machine Pec Fly
  
Additionally, my top game currently is [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/).
Something that I cooked recently that I am proud of is this [beef stew served with rice](images/beef_stew.jpg).  

## Who I am as a programmer

### Past
As a programmer, I felt like my skills really developed in CSE 100 and CSE 15L (*Software Tools&Techniques Lab*). 
In CSE 100, I learned a lot about the general idea of data structures and how to determine which one would be suitable to use. 
In this class, we worked on implementing various data structures in C++, in which I also learned about. For example, after a lot of these PA's (and projects), I got used to typing things like `Node* curr = this->root;`

### Present
As a student, I am trying to learn as much as I can about programming before
