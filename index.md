## Who I am as a person

### Academia

For me, I feel like my major directly reflects my academic passion, as I enjoy the theory behind mathematics combined with the intricacies and creativeness of computer science. 
Some of my favorite classes that I have already taken include:  
* Math 184 (*Enumerative Combinatorics*)
> test
* CSE 100 (*Advanced Data Structures*)
* Math 103A (*Modern Algebra I*)
* CSE 101 (*Design & Analysis of Algorithm*)
